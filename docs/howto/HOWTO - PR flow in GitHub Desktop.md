# HOWTO — Pull Request with GitHub Desktop

**ABBRs used:** PR (Pull Request), GUI (Graphical User Interface)

1) Open GitHub Desktop → select your repo.  
2) **New Branch…** → name like `feature/short-name` → **Create Branch**.  
3) Make changes in VS Code.  
4) Back in Desktop → you’ll see changed files → write a small summary → **Commit to <branch>**.  
5) **Publish branch** (if it’s new).  
6) **Create Pull Request** → base `main`, compare your branch → **Create**.  
7) **Merge** after checks pass.

**Why PRs:** They keep main clean and give you a history of decisions.
