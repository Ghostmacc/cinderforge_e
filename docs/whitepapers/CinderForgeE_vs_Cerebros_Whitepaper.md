## Executive Summary

CinderForge E is a *dynamics‑first* neural architecture search (NAS) framework that brings **real‑time dynamical control** into model search and training. It integrates **Raincatcher**, a runtime instrumentation layer that measures and regulates signal dynamics via three fast metrics:

- **PLV** (phase‑locking value) — attractor strength (coherence);
- **σ** (branching factor) — criticality around the edge‑of‑chaos;
- **λ** (local Lyapunov proxy) — expansion vs. contraction.

Together, these signals enable **closed‑loop nudging** (observe → gentle → hard) and **auto‑mode** switching inside the NAS loop, yielding more stable training, better long‑context behavior, and improved sample efficiency.

This paper describes how CinderForge E can **outperform the public “Cerebros” projects** (by David Thrower) across stability, controllability, scaling, and scientific accountability. We provide testable protocols, ablations, and reproducibility recipes designed for fair, public head‑to‑head evaluation.

> **What “win” means here.** We define “beating” as achieving **strictly better results under equal or lower compute** on objective, auditable metrics: (1) training stability and convergence under long sequences; (2) tokens/sec and memory at fixed batch × length; (3) long‑context recall; (4) reproducibility; and (5) dynamical health (PLV/σ/λ) **without manual babysitting**.

## Background: What the public **Cerebros** repos claim

The **cerebros-core-algorithm-alpha** repository describes an *ultra‑precise NAS / AutoML* approach with random connectivity, lateral links, and an emphasis on biological inspiration. It highlights long‑sequence scaling and reports **“practical O(n)” timing for continuous Transformers**, with an integration pathway for **iRoPE** (improved RoPE) and a bench table for increasing sequence lengths (e.g., 1024–3072). It provides Keras/TensorFlow implementations and emphasizes random graph wiring plus lateral connectivity for robustness. 〔sources: repository README and bench table〕

**Key takeaways from their README (for fair comparison):**
- Random/lateral connectivity and biologically inspired motifs;
- Claimed *practical O(n)* behavior for long sequences;
- Integrations with iRoPE and sample timing tables;
- Keras/TensorFlow codebase with NAS/AutoML framing.

> We will treat those statements as *baselines to match or exceed* under a single, shared test harness.

## CinderForge E: What’s Different (and Why It Matters)

### 1) **Dynamics‑First Objective**
Most NAS frameworks optimize only *loss*. CinderForge E integrates **Raincatcher** to shape the *trajectory* of learning:

- **PLV** (Hilbert analytic phase of cosine‑similarity over embeddings) measures convergence to attractors.
- **σ** approximates branching via symbol‑transition out‑degree.
- **λ** penalizes expansive dynamics (chaotic drift), tolerates contractive behavior.

These are **cheap O(T)** computations on token streams and embed vectors, so they scale with sequence length with negligible overhead.

### 2) **Closed‑Loop Control (Modes)**
- **observe** — no nudging; log RC metrics;
- **gentle** — small chaos penalty inside the study objective (stability‑first);
- **hard** — strong penalty to push away from chaotic drift;
- **auto** — switches between gentle/hard based on live PLV/σ bands.

This control exists **inside** the NAS loop (Optuna objective), so architectures are selected *because they behave well*, not just because they minimize a myopic loss curve.

### 3) **Linear‑Time Long‑Context Units**
We support **mhla_rope** (multi‑head linear attention with RoPE‑family position encoding) as a first‑class *O(n)* unit, plus SSM/linear‑attn choices. This puts CFE and Cerebros in a fair long‑sequence regime.

### 4) **Telemetry + Explainability**
CFE emits per‑trial artifacts: `tokens.ndjson`, `summary.json`, `rc_precise.json/md`, and **heartbeat** logs for live progress. RC metrics produce a **testable story** of why a run converged or failed (attractor strength, criticality, expansion).

## What We’ve Already Observed (internal proof points)

All runs below used a 4090‑class GPU with **bf16** where available:

- Quick NAS sweeps on *mhla_rope, seq_len=256* showed **stable convergence**; *gentle* nudging frequently outperformed *hard* on synthetic tasks (e.g., best loss ≈ **0.1486** in gentle mode; best hard‑mode score ≈ **0.4797** under our objective that includes stability terms).  
- Raincatcher on trial token streams produced **PLV ≈ 0.968** (window 64), i.e., a strong attractor detected with low λ (contractive), while σ≈1.5 indicated super‑critical symbol branching on that synthetic stream—signaling *controllable novelty* that can be tuned by mode/penalty.

> These are task‑local findings; we do **not** claim generalization until the public benchmarks below are run. They do, however, demonstrate the *mechanism of advantage*: online stability signals actively shape the NAS search, which Cerebros currently does not expose.

## Head‑to‑Head Evaluation Protocol (Public, Fair, Auditable)

We propose a **four‑track** comparison under matched compute budgets:

1. **Stability & Convergence (Long Sequences)**  
   *Task:* synthetic sequence classification and retrieval with **L = {1k, 2k, 4k, 8k}**.  
   *Metrics:* final loss @ fixed steps, NAN/INF rate, gradient‑norm outliers, early‑stop frequency.  
   *Win condition:* Lower loss with fewer or equal steps; fewer instabilities.

2. **Throughput & Memory** *(O(n) reality check)*  
   *Task:* forward‑only and train‑step throughput at **B × L** grids, report tokens/sec and peak GB.  
   *Win condition:* Higher tokens/sec and ≤ memory @ same device & precision.  
   *Note:* We also report **effective O(n)** by fitting time vs. length on log‑log plots.

3. **Long‑Context Recall (Needle‑in‑a‑Haystack‑style)**  
   *Task:* retrieval at **8k–32k** with distractors.  
   *Metrics:* exact‑match recall @ k, degradation slope vs. length.  
   *Win condition:* Higher recall at each L, flatter degradation.

4. **Dynamical Health (RC metrics)**  
   *Task:* log PLV/σ/λ on the *same* batches for both systems.  
   *Win condition:* CFE attains PLV within target band (e.g., 0.5–0.7) with σ≈1 while maintaining accuracy/throughput—evidence of *controlled, non‑chaotic competence*.

**Fairness:** Each system will be tuned by its own recommended settings (e.g., Cerebros’s iRoPE option and connectivity defaults; CFE’s mhla_rope and RC modes). Both receive identical budgets (steps, wall power cap, batch × length).

---

## Why We Expect CinderForge E to Win

1. **Search with a better objective.** Adding stability priors (PLV/σ/λ) *during the search itself* makes the discovered topologies *intrinsically easier to train* at long L.  
2. **Real‑time regulation.** Auto‑mode switching prevents the model from getting trapped in over‑coherent attractors (high PLV) or chaotic drift (positive λ).  
3. **Linear‑time building blocks.** Our mhla_rope + SSM options are designed for O(n) regimes—same asymptotic claims, but *with* stability control.  
4. **Scientific accountability.** Every trial leaves a paper trail (NDJSON tokens, RC summaries, heartbeats), enabling *post‑hoc causality* analysis of failures/successes.

## Reproduction (CFE side)

```bash
# 1) Install
python -m venv .venv-gpu
.\.venv-gpu\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e .
pip install "torch>=2.4" scipy sentence-transformers networkx pyyaml optuna

# 2) Quick sanity run (short)
cfe-study --trials 1 --epochs 1 --device cuda --precision bf16 \
  --seq_len 256 --batch_size 128 --steps_per_epoch 8 --accum_steps 2 \
  --unit_type mhla_rope --rc_mode observe

# 3) Long-seq check (tunable budgets)
cfe-study --trials 4 --epochs 4 --device cuda --precision bf16 \
  --seq_len 4096 --batch_size 8 --steps_per_epoch 24 --accum_steps 2 \

Artifacts per trial are written under `reports/study_*/t*/`.  
Use `raincatcher` to compute precise RC metrics on the produced `tokens.ndjson`:

```bash
raincatcher --log_file reports\study_...\t000\tokens.ndjson \
  --plv_window 64 --plv_thresh 0.7 --device cpu --precision fp32 \
  --out_json reports\study_...\t000\rc_precise.json \
  --out_md   reports\study_...\t000\rc_precise.md
```

**Live heartbeat tail (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$study = Get-ChildItem .\reports\study_* -Directory | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Desc | Select-Object -First 1
$trial = Get-ChildItem "$($study.FullName)\t*" -Directory | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Desc | Select-Object -First 1
Get-Content (Join-Path $trial.FullName "heartbeat.ndjson") -Wait -Tail 20
```

## Reproduction (Cerebros side)

Run per the **cerebros-core-algorithm-alpha** README using their Keras/TensorFlow implementation and **enable their suggested long‑sequence and iRoPE settings**. Apply the identical **B × L** grids and step budgets. Log GPU time/memory via `nvidia-smi` and store any existent training logs.

> We rely on their own repository descriptions for configuration guidance and claims about long‑sequence practicality and iRoPE integration. See the repository README and timing table. (Citations below.)

## Results Template and Reporting

We will publish, for each L ∈ {1k, 2k, 4k, 8k}:

- **Loss vs. steps** curves (median, IQR over 3 seeds).  
- **Tokens/sec** and **peak memory (GB)**.  
- **Recall@k** for long‑context retrieval.  
- **PLV/σ/λ** trajectories with target bands (0.5–0.7 PLV; σ≈1; λ≤0).  
- Full configs and seeds.

A result counts as a **win** if CFE ≥ Cerebros while holding compute and precision equal.

---

## Initial Internal Evidence (for mechanism, not victory claim)

From live sessions on Windows + CUDA (bf16):

- CFE delivered **high PLV (≈0.968)** on trial tokens with **negative λ** (contractive) and adjustable σ via RC modes—evidence of controllable attractors.  
- *Gentle* mode typically yielded faster & smoother convergence than *hard* on the synthetic task, supporting the thesis that *stability‑nudging is beneficial during search*.  
- Heartbeat logging plus NDJSON tokens enabled rapid inspection and re‑runs with fixed seeds.

These findings guide the head‑to‑head strategy but are **not** yet claims of public benchmark victory. We will publish raw logs and scripts.

---

## Ablations (to isolate contributions)

1. **Remove RC nudging** (observe only) vs. **gentle** vs. **hard** vs. **auto**.  
2. **Swap units**: mhla_rope ↔ linear_attn ↔ ssm_diag (matched params).  
3. **Turn off PLV, σ, λ terms** within the penalty individually.  
4. **Vary PLV window** and target bands to test sensitivity.  
5. **Noise injection** during token logging to test attractor robustness.

Expected outcome: Each component contributes additive stability/throughput gains; the *auto* regulator avoids regressions at extreme lengths.

---

## Threats to Validity & Mitigations

- **Implementation variance** (PyTorch vs. Keras/TF): we equalize steps, precision, B × L, and report *effective* O(n) by measuring time‑vs‑L.  
- **Task mismatch**: we publish dataset generators and corpora; both sides run exactly the same tasks.  
- **Tuning asymmetry**: each side uses *its own* recommended settings; we limit manual poking and cap compute budgets identically.  
- **Overfitting to metrics**: we audit **generalization** on held sets and report RC metrics *alongside* accuracy/recall.

---

## Conclusion

CinderForge E’s novelty is **not** only new blocks; it is a **control system** for learning dynamics embedded *inside* NAS. This lets us search for architectures that are fast **and** stay in healthy dynamical regimes, then keep them there at runtime via auto‑regulation. Under equal compute, that additional information and control should yield **more stable, faster, and longer‑context‑capable models** than the public Cerebros repos.

We will release full head‑to‑head logs, configs, and scripts.
